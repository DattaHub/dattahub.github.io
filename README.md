## About 
This is an website for current projects, intended for sharing codes for recently developed Statistical methods. 
I am trying to make these github.io pages as self-sufficient as possible, with references linked wherever needed. 
Please let me know if you find any typos or inconsistencies in any of the codes or their descriptions. 

## Disclaimer:

All the R markdown and HTML slides posted in this site: in sub-folders stat5525, cmda2014 (VT), and stat3013, stat4033 and stat5433 (UArk) were created for demonstrating different methods for data analysis and probability calculations to different classes of students. The source material for these slides are mentioned whenever possible.
